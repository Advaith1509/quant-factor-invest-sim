# 📈 Quantitative Factor Investing Simulator

A comprehensive simulator for multi-factor stock investing that leverages fundamental data, machine learning, and portfolio optimization to construct and evaluate outperforming strategies - complete with an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **Quantitative Factor Investing** framework using multiple factor models (Value, Momentum, Quality, Volume, Volatility). It enables:
- Clean data ingestion from raw financial datasets
- Computation of factor scores
- Construction of a composite score using custom weights
- Stock ranking and portfolio creation (equal-weighted and risk-adjusted)
- Machine learning-based return prediction
- Backtesting and performance comparison vs S&P 500
- Visualization through a live dashboard

> 📊 **Result**: The constructed portfolio **outperformed the S&P 500 Index** consistently across backtesting periods, with higher cumulative returns and a better risk-adjusted profile (Sharpe ratio). The results are displayed in the report.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Integration

ML was used to predict future returns based on:
- Past factor scores
- Fundamental metrics
- Price-volume dynamics

Model: `RandomForestRegressor`  
Output: Predicted return score → used to adjust final stock ranking and improve alpha capture.
