# üìà ***Quantitative Factor Investing Simulator***

A comprehensive simulator for multi-factor stock investing that leverages fundamental data, machine learning, and portfolio optimization to construct and evaluate outperforming strategies - complete with an interactive dashboard.

---

## üöÄ ***Overview***

This project implements a **Quantitative Factor Investing** framework using multiple factor models (Value, Momentum, Quality, Volume, Volatility). It enables:
- Clean data ingestion from raw financial datasets
- Computation of factor scores using both existing rules and an ML model.
- Construction of a composite score using custom weights
- Stock ranking and portfolio creation (equal-weighted and risk-adjusted)
- Machine learning-based return prediction
- Backtesting and performance comparison of ML-based portfolio and Rule-based portfolio vs S&P 500
- Visualization through a live dashboard 

> **Result**: The constructed portfolio **outperformed the S&P 500 Index** consistently across backtesting periods, with higher cumulative returns and a better risk-adjusted profile (Sharpe ratio). The results are displayed in the report.

## üìä ***Results: Portfolio vs S&P 500***

### Rule-Based Portfolio
| Metric                  | Portfolio (Risk-Adjusted) | S&P 500 Index |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Cumulative Return       | 211.41%                   | 71.3%         |
| Annualized Return       | 19.2%                     | 15.6%         |
| Sharpe Ratio            | 0.862                     | 0.86          |
| Max Drawdown            | -39.21%                   | -13.4%        |

### ML-Based Portfolio
| Metric                  | Portfolio (Risk-Adjusted) | S&P 500 Index |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Cumulative Return       | 145.57%                   | 71.3%         |
| Annualized Return       | 28.86%                    | 15.6%         |
| Sharpe Ratio            | 1.385                     | 0.86          |
| Max Drawdown            | -32.07%                   | -13.4%        |

> Outperformance is driven by factor-based filtering, ML-enhanced ranking, and dynamic weighting in both portfolios when compared to the S&P 500 index over that period.
