# üìà ***QuantSim: A Quantitative Factor Investing Simulator***

A comprehensive simulator for multi-factor stock investing that leverages fundamental data, machine learning, NLP-based sentiment analysis, and portfolio optimization to construct and evaluate outperforming strategies, complete with an interactive dashboard.

---

## üöÄ ***Overview***

This project implements a **Quantitative Factor Investing** framework using multiple factor models (Value, Momentum, Quality, Volume, Volatility) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based sentiment signals (when live data values are integrated into it). It enables:
- Clean data ingestion from raw financial datasets
- Computation of factor scores using both existing rules and an ML model
- Sentiment scoring using FinBERT to enhance decision-making with real-world financial sentiment
- Construction of a composite score using custom weights (including sentiment)
- Stock ranking and portfolio creation (equal-weighted and risk-adjusted)
- Machine learning-based return prediction
- Backtesting and performance comparison of ML-based portfolio and Rule-based portfolio vs S&P 500
- Visualization through a live dashboard

> **Result**: The constructed portfolio ***outperformed the S&P 500 Index*** consistently across backtesting periods, with higher cumulative returns and a better risk-adjusted profile (Sharpe ratio). The results are displayed in the report.

## üß© ***Features***

- ***Data Loader***:
  - Load & clean price, fundamental, price-split-adjusted and security datasets
- ***Factor Scoring***:
  - Value, Momentum, Quality, Volume, Volatility
- ***Sentiment Analysis***:
  - Financial news headlines scored using *FinBERT* (Hugging Face)
  - Sentiment factor computed as `positive-negative` sentiment
  - Aggregated by date and symbol for integration into the factor model
- ***Composite Score***:
  - Custom weighted average of individual factor scores, including NLP sentiment scores for future use
- ***ML Model***:
  - Predictive modeling of stock returns (RandomForest Regressor)
- ***Portfolio Construction:***
  - Top-50 stocks selected based on composite/ML predicted scores
  - Equal weighting & volatility-adjusted weighting strategies
- ***Backtesting Engine:***
  - Cumulative return plots
  - S&P 500 benchmark comparison
  - Sharpe, volatility, drawdown metrics
- ***Streamlit Dashboard:***
  - Interactive filters, stock tables, and charts for visualization

## üìä ***Results: Portfolio vs S&P 500***

### Rule-Based Portfolio
| Metric                  | Portfolio (Risk-Adjusted) | S&P 500 Index |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Cumulative Return       | 211.41%                   | 71.3%         |
| Annualized Return       | 19.2%                     | 15.6%         |
| Sharpe Ratio            | 0.862                     | 0.86          |
| Max Drawdown            | -39.21%                   | -13.4%        |

### ML-Based Portfolio
| Metric                  | Portfolio (Risk-Adjusted) | S&P 500 Index |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Cumulative Return       | 145.57%                   | 71.3%         |
| Annualized Return       | 28.86%                    | 15.6%         |
| Sharpe Ratio            | 1.385                     | 0.86          |
| Max Drawdown            | -32.07%                   | -13.4%        |

> Outperformance is driven by factor-based filtering, ML-enhanced ranking, **sentiment-aware signal integration**, and dynamic weighting in both portfolios when compared to the S&P 500 index over that period.
